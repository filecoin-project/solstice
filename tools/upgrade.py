"""Every step of an SRA/SWA implementation upgrade, as one command each. See docs/UPGRADE.md.

Both contracts are always upgraded together, so every operation acts on both.

Environment:
  ETH_RPC_URL           required; selects the network (chain id 314 or 314159)
  DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY  the operations key: registered once by an owner of each Safe as a proposer
                        (https://help.safe.global/articles/1671337645-proposers) for `propose`; any funded key
                        for `execute`; its address is shown by `check-setup`
  DRY_RUN=1             for propose: build and sign the Safe transactions but do not post them
  NETWORK_NAME          for `verify --record-release`: the label written into the release ("Calibnet" or "Mainnet")

`propose` first makes the `check-setup` checks and posts nothing unless every owner Safe is an owner on its proxy
and has the key as a proposer. It then runs script/Verify.s.sol with the new addresses as candidates, which rebuilds
both implementations from the checked-out source and refuses unless the on-chain runtime code matches, so the queued
transactions always refer to code built from this commit. See docs/UPGRADE.md step 4 for what happens after the proposals are queued.
