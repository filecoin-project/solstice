"""Storage layout gate for the upgradeable SRA and SWA contracts.

The contracts keep every piece of state in ERC-7201 namespaced structs reached through fixed slots, so
`forge inspect <Contract> storageLayout` is empty for them. test/layout/StorageLayoutProbe.sol declares one
state variable per namespace; this tool asks the compiler for that probe's layout and keeps a normalized copy
in storage-layout/layout.json. The slot constants themselves are pinned by test/StorageSlots.t.sol.

Upgrade-safe (--compat passes) means: every namespace keeps its ERC-7201 id string, and so its base slot; every
storage leaf present at <ref> (a non-struct field, reached through
any nesting of structs, mapping values and array elements) is still there at the same slot and offset within
its region, with the same type and byte width, and array elements keep their size. New fields may be added
anywhere that moves nothing: appended to a struct, in unused bytes of an existing slot, or as a new namespace.
Anything else would reinterpret live storage behind the proxy and needs a migration, which docs/UPGRADE.md
does not cover.
