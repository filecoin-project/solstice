// - compute service-stream shares and write them to f02 (SetShares)

// Storage: 2 ERC-7201 namespaces (Registry/Quarter),

// Governance: every method runs the dual-Safe unanimous path with no hold (unanimousNoHold) —
// the second approval executes immediately. A task clears only when its body executes without
// reverting. If the body reverts, the whole approval transaction rolls back (record deletion
// included), so the task stays pending and the second owner can re-approve the same calldata —
// a failed run strands nothing. The second Safe MUST dry-run the calldata before approving.
